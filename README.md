## To do
- make `v` created in the `powert_method`` function a vector with norm 1.
- adjust outputs of the `power_method`function to be compatible with the test function. This is required as the future expansion of the project is expected to have the same compatibility requirements.
- slim down `power_method` function to optimize runtime.
